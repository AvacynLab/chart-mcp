## Model Providers

This template targets the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) by default through the AI SDK. The examples are wired against models such as `gpt-5-nano`, but you can point the configuration to any other OpenAI deployment or compatible endpoint.

### OpenAI Authentication

Provide an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file (or the hosting platform’s secret manager) so server actions and the Playwright suites can authenticate. When the variable is absent the project automatically falls back to the mock provider used for local E2E runs.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to other providers like [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

If you plan to run the Playwright test suite locally, download the required browsers manually after install:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
```

> The repository disables automatic browser downloads during `pnpm install` to keep CI environments without external network access green.

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
